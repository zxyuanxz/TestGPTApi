# TestGPTApi Repository

This repository contains two Python scripts:

## testApi.py
This script tests various AI models by sending requests to an API endpoint. It includes:
- A list of models to test.
- A prompt to query the models.
- Code to handle API requests and display responses.

## testNextChat.py
This script performs batch testing of multiple AI models concurrently. It includes:
- A list of models from various providers (e.g., Google Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT).
- A prompt to query the models.
- Multithreading to send requests to the API and process responses efficiently.

Both scripts demonstrate how to interact with AI APIs and handle responses programmatically.
